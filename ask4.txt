in this world with trees, rocks, water, animated animals, scrap metal, nails and tall grass. Barrels are searchable for additional loot. There are empty buildings with containers inside them which can also be search for loot. Trees, rocks, scrap metal, grass, and water and animals can be found on the map.  On the player pop-up build menu the player can craft these items: axe, pix axe, campfire, crafting table, and forge, rope. All items that are located in the quick bar and inventory are searched for resources when crafting an item. When an item is crafted it's automatically place in the first open quick-slots, if non are available then it's placed in the players inventory. The player can gather wood by havesting tree by chopping them with the axe and rocks from harvesting with the pix axe to get stones, gathering tall grass to make rope, scrap metal which can be used in the forge. Killing an animal the resources collected are meat, leather and fat. The player spawns with an axe, pic axe, knife and catien for holding water. when placing meat from an animal in a camp fire it takes about 30 seconds to cook each item. water needs to cooked in the cantien at a campfire to steralize the water for drinking. The player can craft a crafting table and forge. 

I want an inventory to pop-up when I press the TAB key. I want to be able to move things from my inventory to my quick bar easily by holding the SHIFT key and lefy clikcing with my mouose will move items to and from my hot bar.  I want the game to start and ask how many resources I want in my inventory, also be able to adjust player speed and hight.  

There should be live moving animals walking around the map. Inside the empty building there should be crates of searchable items that give you additional loot.
